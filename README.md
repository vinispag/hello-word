# hello-word
First repository

Hi. My name is Vinicius, Electrical Engineer, I used to work with railway projects, but I want to start to work with coding. I am a good developer in VBA, C++, C, Python and DXL. I know also how to code in HTML, Java, Flash and Java for Android, I'm just a little rusty at those. Started GitHub today and I hope to get used to the coding lifestyle soon.
